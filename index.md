## Introduction to Mobius

# <em>Graphing Absolute Value Functions</em>

Graph y=2|x+3|-7

<ol>
  <li> Determine vertex. That's the point where the term inside the aboslute value is 0, so here that is
    when x + 3 = 0. Enter vertex as orderd pair (<em>a,b</em>) -> (-3,-7) </li>
  <li> Determine a second point on the line. Often it's easy to use the value x = 0. Here when x = 0, y = <mark>-1</mark></li>
</ol>

# <em><strong>Graphing Quadratic Polynomial Functions (Parabolas)</strong></em>

A quadratic polynomial function can be written in vertex (which our OpenStax textbook calls standard) form as 

y = a ( x - h )^2 + k

where (h,k) is the vertex of the parabola.

Here are steps to drawing a parabola using the vertex - one other point method:

<ol>
  <li> Determine the vertex of the parabola. </li>
  <li> Determine another point on the parabola. Often using  x=0  can simplify the calculations (if it's not the vertex). </li>
  <li> Make sure that the draw-parabola button parabola vertex point icon is highlighted in red. </li>
  <li> Click on the graph to first place the vertex. </li>
  <li> Click on the graph to then place the other point. </li> 
  <li> Mobius will connect the two points with a parabola. </li>
  <li> Remember that you can drag the points around with your mouse, even after Mobius has drawn the parabola. </li>
</ol>

## Linear Inequalities and Absolute Value Inequalities

# <strong>LEARNING OBJECTIVE</strong>

In this section you will:
<ul>
  <li> Use interval notation</li>
  <li> Use properties of inequalities</li>
  <li> Solve inequalities in one variable algebraically</li>
  <li> Solve absolute value inequalities</li>
</ul>

# Using Interval Notation 

----------------------------------------------------------

Indicating the solution to an inequality such as  x≥4  can be achieved in several ways.

We can use a number line as shown in Figure 2. The blue ray begins at  x=4  and, as indicated by the arrowhead, continues to infinity, which illustrates that the solution set includes all real numbers greater than or equal to  4 .

We can use set-builder notation:  {x|x≥4} , which translates to “all real numbers  x  such that  x  is greater than or equal to  4 .” Notice that braces are used to indicate a set.

The third method is <strong>interval notation</strong>, in which solution sets are indicated with parentheses or brackets. The solutions to  x≥4  are represented as  [4,∞) . This is perhaps the most useful method, as it applies to concepts studied later in this course and to other higher-level math courses.

The main concept to remember is that parentheses represent solutions greater or less than the number, and brackets represent solutions that are greater than or equal to or less than or equal to the number. Use parentheses to represent infinity or negative infinity, since positive and negative infinity are not numbers in the usual sense of the word and, therefore, cannot be “equaled.” A few examples of an <strong>interval</strong>, or a set of numbers in which a solution falls, are  [−2,6) , or all numbers between  −2  and  6 , including  −2 , but not including  6 ;  (−1,0) , all real numbers between, but not including  −1  and  0 ; and  (−∞,1] , all real numbers less than and including  1 . <strong>Table 1</strong> outlines the possibilities.

# Using the Properties of Inequalities

-----------------------------------------------------------

properties of inequalities
  Addition Property If  a<b , then  a+c<b+c .
  Multiplication Property If  a<b  and  c>0 , then  ac<bc .
    If  a<b  and  c<0 , then  ac>bc .
These properties also apply to  a≤b ,  a>b , and  a≥b .
  
  <strong>Demonstrating addition property</strong>
  
  Illustrate the addition property for inequalities by solving the following:
  
  a. x - 15 < 4 
  b. 6 >/= x - 1
  c.  x + 7 > 9
  
  a. add 15 to both sides
  
  b. add 1 to both sides
  
  c. subtract 7 from both sides
  
  # <strong>Using Arrow Notation</strong>

  Several things are apparent if we examine the graph of  f(x)=1x .

1. On the left branch of the graph, the curve approaches the  x -axis ( y=0 ) as  x→−∞ .
  
2. As the graph approaches  x=0  from the left, the curve drops, but as we approach zero from the right, the curve rises.
  
3. Finally, on the right branch of the graph, the curves approaches the  x -axis ( y=0 ) as  x→∞ .
  
  We use arrow notation to show that <em>x</em> or <em>f</em>(x) is approaching a particular value.

  <strong>Local Behavior of f(x) = 1/x</strong>
  
  We cannot divide by zero, which means the function is undefined at x = 0; so zero is not in the domain. As the input values approach zero from the left (becomoing very small, negative values), the function values decrease without bound (in other words, they approach negative infinity). See table 2.

Writing in arrow notation

 As the input values approach zero from the right (becoming very small, positive values), the function values  increase without bound (approaching infinity). See Table 3.
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100523016/177025716-49df3fef-efb8-46e8-ba05-886b0dd4a0b3.png)

  The behaviors create a <strong>vertical asymptote</strong>, which is a vertical line that the graph approaches but never crosses. In this case the graph is approaching the vertical line x = 0 as the input becomes close to zero. See Figure 3.
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100523016/177025769-3e77f63d-1648-4538-8da2-f9a103420925.png)

 Based on this overall behavior and the graph, we can see that the function approaches 0 but never actually reaches 0; it seems to level off as the inputs become large. This behavior creates a <strong>horizontal asymptote</strong>, a horizontal line that the graph approaches as the input increases or decreases without bound. In this case, the graph is approaching the horizontal line y=0. See Figure 5.
