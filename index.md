# Module 2

In this module, you'll study properties of exponential and logarithmic functions. You will study the rules for and graphs of general exponential functions and powers of e. Additionally, you'll study rules for and graphs of common logarithms and natural logarithms. 

During this module, you'll be introduced to new terms and concepts, such as <mark><em>exponential function</em></mark> (a function where the base is a number and the exponent is the variable), a <mark><em>logarithmic function</em></mark> (the inverse to the process of evaluating exponents), the <mark><em>common logarithm</em></mark> (a loarithmic function where to the base is 10), and <mark><em>natural logarithm</em></mark> (a logarithmic function where the base is e).

# Defining an Exponential Function

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Percent change</strong> refers to a <em>change</em> based on a <em>percent</em> of the original amount</li>
  <li> <strong>Exponential growth</strong> regers to an <em>increase</em> based on a constant multiplicative rate of change over equal incrememtns of time, that is, a <em>percent</em> increase of the original amount over time.</li>
  <li> <strong>Exponential decay</strong> refers to a <em>decrease</em> based on a constant multiplicative rate of change over equal incrememnts of time, that is <em>percent</em> decrease of the original amount over time. </li>
</ul>

To clearly understand exponential growth, contrast exponential growth with linear growth. Two functions has been constructed; the first function is exponential. Starting with an input of 0, and increase each input by 1. We double the corresponding consecutive outputs. The second function is linear. We begin with an input of 0, and increase each input by 1. We add 2 to the correspongindg consecutive outputs. See <strong>Table 1</strong>

In <strong>Table 2</strong> we can infer that for these two functions, exponential growth dwarfs linear growth.

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Exponential growth</strong> refers to the original value from the range increases by the <em>same percentage</em> over equal increments found in the domain. </li>
  <li> <strong>Linear growth</strong> refers to the original value from the range increases by the <em>same amount</em> over equal incrememnts found in the domain. </li>
</ul>

There is a significant difference between "the same percentage" and "the same amount." For exponential growth, over equal incrememnts, the constant multiplicative rate of change resulted in doubling the output whenever the input increased by one. For linear growth, the constant additive rate of change over equal incrememnts resulted in adding 2 to the output whenever the input was increased by one. 

The general form of the exponential function is  f(x)=abx , where  a  is any nonzero number,  b  is a positive real number not equal to  1.

<ul>
  <li> If  b>1 , the function grows at a rate proportional to its size.</li>
  <li> If  0<b<1 , the function decays at a rate proportional to its size. </li>
</ul>

Let’s look at the function  f(x)=2x  from our example. We will create a table (<strong>Table 2</strong>) to determine the corresponding outputs over an interval in the domain from  −3  to  3 .

## Evaluating Functions with Base e

Earlier, we saw the amount earned on an account increases as the compounding frequency increases. <strong>Table 5</strong> shows that the increase from annual to semi-annual compunding is larger than the increase from monthly to daily compounding. 

Examine the vale of $1 invested at 100% interest for 1 year, compounded at various frequencies, listed in <strong>Table 5</strong>

These values appear to be approaching a limit as n increases without bound. In fact, as n gets larger and larger, the expression (1 +1/n)^n approaches a number used so frequently in mathematics that it has its own name: the letter e. This value is an irrational number, which means that its decimal expansion goes on forever without repeating. Its approximation to six decimal places is shown below.
