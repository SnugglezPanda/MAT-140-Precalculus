# Module 2

In this module, you'll study properties of exponential and logarithmic functions. You will study the rules for and graphs of general exponential functions and powers of e. Additionally, you'll study rules for and graphs of common logarithms and natural logarithms. 

During this module, you'll be introduced to new terms and concepts, such as <mark><em>exponential function</em></mark> (a function where the base is a number and the exponent is the variable), a <mark><em>logarithmic function</em></mark> (the inverse to the process of evaluating exponents), the <mark><em>common logarithm</em></mark> (a loarithmic function where to the base is 10), and <mark><em>natural logarithm</em></mark> (a logarithmic function where the base is e).
