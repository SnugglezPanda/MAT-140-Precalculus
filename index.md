## Introduction to Mobius

# <em>Graphing Absolute Value Functions</em>

Graph y=2|x+3|-7

<ol>
  <li> Determine vertex. That's the point where the term inside the aboslute value is 0, so here that is
    when x + 3 = 0. Enter vertex as orderd pair (<em>a,b</em>) -> (-3,-7) </li>
  <li> Determine a second point on the line. Often it's easy to use the value x = 0. Here when x = 0, y = <mark>-1</mark></li>
</ol>

# <em><strong>Graphing Quadratic Polynomial Functions (Parabolas)</strong></em>

A quadratic polynomial function can be written in vertex (which our OpenStax textbook calls standard) form as 

y = a ( x - h )^2 + k

where (h,k) is the vertex of the parabola.

Here are steps to drawing a parabola using the vertex - one other point method:

<ol>
  <li> Determine the vertex of the parabola. </li>
  <li> Determine another point on the parabola. Often using  x=0  can simplify the calculations (if it's not the vertex). </li>
  <li> Make sure that the draw-parabola button parabola vertex point icon is highlighted in red. </li>
  <li> Click on the graph to first place the vertex. </li>
  <li> Click on the graph to then place the other point. </li> 
  <li> Mobius will connect the two points with a parabola. </li>
  <li> Remember that you can drag the points around with your mouse, even after Mobius has drawn the parabola. </li>
</ol>

## Linear Inequalities and Absolute Value Inequalities

# <strong>LEARNING OBJECTIVE</strong>

In this section you will:
<ul>
  <li> Use interval notation</li>
  <li> Use properties of inequalities</li>
  <li> Solve inequalities in one variable algebraically</li>
  <li> Solve absolute value inequalities</li>
</ul>

# Using Interval Notation 

----------------------------------------------------------

Indicating the solution to an inequality such as  x≥4  can be achieved in several ways.

We can use a number line as shown in Figure 2. The blue ray begins at  x=4  and, as indicated by the arrowhead, continues to infinity, which illustrates that the solution set includes all real numbers greater than or equal to  4 .

We can use set-builder notation:  {x|x≥4} , which translates to “all real numbers  x  such that  x  is greater than or equal to  4 .” Notice that braces are used to indicate a set.

The third method is <strong>interval notation</strong>, in which solution sets are indicated with parentheses or brackets. The solutions to  x≥4  are represented as  [4,∞) . This is perhaps the most useful method, as it applies to concepts studied later in this course and to other higher-level math courses.

The main concept to remember is that parentheses represent solutions greater or less than the number, and brackets represent solutions that are greater than or equal to or less than or equal to the number. Use parentheses to represent infinity or negative infinity, since positive and negative infinity are not numbers in the usual sense of the word and, therefore, cannot be “equaled.” A few examples of an <strong>interval</strong>, or a set of numbers in which a solution falls, are  [−2,6) , or all numbers between  −2  and  6 , including  −2 , but not including  6 ;  (−1,0) , all real numbers between, but not including  −1  and  0 ; and  (−∞,1] , all real numbers less than and including  1 . <strong>Table 1</strong> outlines the possibilities.
