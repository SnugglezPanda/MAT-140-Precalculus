## Introduction to Mobius

# <em>Graphing Absolute Value Functions</em>

Graph y = 2 | x + 3 | - 7

<ol>
  <li> Determine vertex. That's the point where the term inside the aboslute value is 0, so here that is
    when x + 3 = 0. Enter vertex as orderd pair (<em>a,b</em>) -> (-3,-7) </li>
  <li> Determine a second point on the line. Often it's easy to use the value x = 0. Here when x = 0, y = <mark>-1</mark></li>
</ol>

# <em><strong>Graphing Quadratic Polynomial Functions (Parabolas)</strong></em>

A quadratic polynomial function can be written in vertex (which our OpenStax textbook calls standard) form as 

y = a ( x - h )^2 + k

where (h,k) is the vertex of the parabola.

Here are steps to drawing a parabola using the vertex - one other point method:

<ol>
  <li> Determine the vertex of the parabola. </li>
  <li> Determine another point on the parabola. Often using  x=0  can simplify the calculations (if it's not the vertex). </li>
  <li> Make sure that the draw-parabola button parabola vertex point icon is highlighted in red. </li>
  <li> Click on the graph to first place the vertex. </li>
  <li> Click on the graph to then place the other point. </li> 
  <li> Mobius will connect the two points with a parabola. </li>
  <li> Remember that you can drag the points around with your mouse, even after Mobius has drawn the parabola. </li>
</ol>
